This project involved developing a web application for a real estate platform where property sellers can advertise their listings with detailed information, including pricing and property specifications. Potential buyers can browse and filter through the available properties based on their preferences. The platform also includes an admin dashboard that allows the company to manage property listings, update details, and monitor user activities. The application integrates user authentication, property search functionality, and a robust database management system to handle property data and user interactions efficiently.
